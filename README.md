# Undead-Immortals-Minigame
  Undead Immortals is a Java-based minigame, where you play as a daring treasure hunter navigating a complex maze.
Use the WASD keys to traverse the rocky labyrinth and reach the treasure in the fewest steps possible.
Can you make it?

  This project is a minigame I came up with and am pretty excited to develop.
I'm looking forward to enriching it with more features and challenges.

I'm currently developing it using:
java version "18.0.1.1" 2022-04-22
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 18.0.1.1+2-6)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 18.0.1.1+2-6, mixed mode, sharing)
